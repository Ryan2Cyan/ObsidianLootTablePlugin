> | :exclamation:  Breaking changes in Obsidian 1.6.3 causing a minor issue - no solution yet|
> |----------------------------------------------|
>
> Obsidian team introduced yet another breaking change in 1.6.3 probably related to plugin's lifecycle or File Explorer module lifecycle.
> In result the custom sort order is not applied automatically and manual (re)application is needed via ribbon click of via 'sort on' command after
> app reload or vault reload.
> 
> For more details of the observed misbehavior (of not updated plugin) you can go to [#147](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/issues/147)
