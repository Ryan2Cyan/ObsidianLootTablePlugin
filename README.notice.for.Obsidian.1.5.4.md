> | :exclamation:  Breaking changes in Obsidian 1.5.4 (and newer) - update the plugin to 2.1.7 or newer|
> |----------------------------------------------|
>
> Obsidian team introduced some breaking changes in File Explorer in a not-backward-compatible way starting from Obsidian 1.5.4.
>
> The **custom sort** plugin starting from release **2.1.7** was adjusted to work correctly with these breaking changes in Obsidian 1.5.4 and newer.
> The plugin remains backward compatible, so you can safely update the plugin for Obsidian earlier than 1.5.4
>
> For more details of the observed misbehavior (of not updated plugin) you can go to [#131](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/issues/131) or [#135](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/issues/135) or [#139](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/issues/139)
