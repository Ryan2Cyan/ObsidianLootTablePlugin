> | :exclamation:  Breaking changes in Obsidian 1.7.2 (and newer) - no fixes available|
> |----------------------------------------------|
>
> Obsidian team introduced some more breaking changes in a not-backward-compatible way starting from Obsidian 1.7.2.
>
> The observed issues are minor, no fixes available (a work in progress with unknown release date):
> - the custom sort plugin is **unable to automatically apply the custom sort on start**
>   - prevalent on mobile
>   - for the _Lazy Plugin Loader_ plugin occurs by definition
>   - **workaround**: custom sorting has to be applied manually via the ribbon icon or the command 'sort on'
> - the custom sort plugin **keeps showing the notifications** with each change to any note
>   - **workaround**: disable the notifications
>
