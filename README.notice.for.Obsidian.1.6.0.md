> | :exclamation:  Breaking changes in Obsidian 1.6.0 (and newer) - update the plugin to 2.1.9 or newer|
> |----------------------------------------------|
>
> Obsidian team introduced some breaking changes in File Explorer sorting code in a not-backward-compatible way starting from Obsidian 1.6.0.
>
> The **custom sort** plugin starting from release **2.1.9** was adjusted to work correctly with these breaking changes in Obsidian 1.6.0 and newer.
> The plugin remains backward compatible, so you can safely update the plugin for Obsidian earlier than 1.6.0
>
> For more details of the observed misbehavior (of not updated plugin) you can go to [#145](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/issues/145)
